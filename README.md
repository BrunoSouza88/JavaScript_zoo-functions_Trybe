# **JavaScript Zoo Functions** 🐘

## **Description** 🚀
As a developer with expertise in ES6, Higher Order Functions, and testing, I was given an important mission by the city hall: to organize the zoo’s information!

I developed functions to search for information about the zoo’s animals, such as their species and place of origin. In addition, I also gathered data about the people who collaborate with the maintenance and care of the zoo.

But that’s not all!

I understand the importance of having a test-oriented mindset and how the implementation of tests contributes to writing more reliable and high-performance code.

The sequence of requirements for this project was arranged to provide me with the experience of understanding in practice how test-driven development helps ensure quality code. I implemented tests for existing functions, realizing the use cases of my application and ensuring that it is working correctly!
